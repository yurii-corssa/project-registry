### Full

First, carefully analyze the project and gather all necessary information (purpose, scope, role, features, implementation details, and outcomes) to ensure the description is complete and accurate.
Then write a full, professional project description in two languages, English and Ukrainian.

**Requirements:**

- Length: 3–7 sentences, around 500–800 characters.
- Start the description with the project name, followed immediately by its purpose (e.g., to showcase front-end skills, to practice, or to deliver a specific product).
- Then describe the development approach and best practices applied, but do not create a full list of technologies — only mention them naturally when relevant.
- Highlight the key sections, components, or features.
- Explain any notable implementation details.
- Conclude with the project’s outcome and value: emphasize usability, responsiveness, maintainability, performance, and its role as a portfolio piece or skill demonstration.

**Style:** professional, clear, detailed, but results-oriented.

<!-- ------------------------------- -->

### Short

First, analyze the project and gather the necessary information (purpose, scope, main features, and outcome).
Then write a concise project description in two languages, English and Ukrainian.

**Requirements:**

- Length: 2–3 sentences, maximum **290 characters**.
- Do not start with the project name, but make it clear that the description refers to this specific project.
- Focus on what the project is and its main purpose.
- Mention key value or outcome briefly.

**Style:** professional, clear, concise, results-focused.

<!-- ------------------------------- -->

### Resume

First, carefully analyze the project and gather all necessary information (purpose, scope, role, features, implementation details, and outcomes) to ensure the description is complete and accurate.
Then write a concise resume-style project description in two languages, English and Ukrainian.

**Requirements:**

- Do not list technologies explicitly (they are mentioned in the project header).
- Length should be 200–350 characters (2–3 sentences max), matching the style of my previous descriptions.
- Structure:
  - Start with project type (individual or team) and its main purpose (e.g., practicing, showcasing, or building something)
  - If it is a team project, clearly state my role (developer, contributor, frontend team lead). For individual projects, do not mention a role.
  - Describe the key features, sections, or tasks I implemented.
  - Conclude with a results-oriented phrase similar to my examples, emphasizing quality and value: optimized for usability and performance, ensuring an intuitive user experience, delivering a responsive high-performance interface, etc.

**Style:** professional, concise, results-focused, consistent with my previous project descriptions."

# [Project Name]

> A short 1–2 sentence tagline describing what this project is and its purpose.

![Project Cover](./assets/[project-cover].webp)

## Description

A concise but detailed paragraph (5–8 sentences) describing the project’s essence:

- Begin with the project name and purpose (e.g., to practice specific technologies, to build a real product, or to showcase development skills).
- Explain the development process and implementation focus.
- Mention important details naturally (e.g., hand-built components, architecture patterns, optimization efforts).
- Emphasize aspects like usability, performance, responsiveness, and maintainability.

## Key Features

List **only the features that are technically significant or complex from a development perspective** — not simple or obvious user-level functions.  
Include features that demonstrate:

- Custom or reusable components
- Architectural or performance optimizations
- Non-trivial implementation logic
- Advanced animation, interaction, or UI effects
- Systems built from scratch (e.g., sliders, modals, parallax, data handling)

Use this structure for each bullet:
`- **Feature Name** – short technical explanation of what it does and how it was implemented.`

## Technology Stack

### **Frontend Technologies**

List the core languages and frameworks (e.g., HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React, etc.)

### **Build Tools**

Mention build tools and linters (e.g., Vite, Webpack, ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS).
